npm run android   # Android Emulator

## Braintree / Cardinal Commerce Maven Repository

The Android build requires credentials for the private Cardinal Commerce Maven repo used by the Braintree SDK. These are **not** committed to the repo.

Set the following environment variables before running `npm run android`:

```bash
export BRAINTREE_MAVEN_USERNAME=braintree_team_sdk
export BRAINTREE_MAVEN_PASSWORD=<password>
```

> Credentials are available in the team's shared secret store (e.g. 1Password / Vault). Ask a team member if you don't have access.

The `mobile/plugins/withBraintreeMavenRepo.js` Expo config plugin reads these via `System.getenv()` and injects them into the Android Gradle build.
